# Acquire-and-Analyze-Book-Reviews


This repository contains a jupyter notebook where I acquire a list of books that have popular appeal and have been reviewed by the New York Times. Then I perform some basic statistics on the text of reviews of those books published in the New York Times. 

## Feedback

Solid work on this analysis. I somehow missed that it's been sitting around for 6 weeks. I can imagine ways to push this further, but this constitutes enough for an A&A. One big miss: not including custom stopwords for the books. Your reviews are getting lots of book titles, which makes the analysis less informative.
